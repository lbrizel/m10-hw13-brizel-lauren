I had trouble understanding the deconstructing part of this assignment

Also, when I run the tests, I keep getting an error for the last part, about displaying the 'last updated time', however, I keep going back and doing it over and I cannot figure out what I would be doing wrong. Also, when I put a city into the widget itself, the last updated time DOES show, and it shows correctly. So I am not really sure what is going on...
